Project Title: Bookstore API

Project Description:

You need to develop an API for a bookstore that will allow customers to browse, purchase and review books. The API should be built using .NET Core and should have the following functionalities:

Browse books: Customers should be able to browse the books available in the bookstore. The API should return a list of books with their details such as title, author, price, and description.

Purchase books: Customers should be able to purchase books from the bookstore. Customers can buy multiple books at once. The API should calculate the total price of the books and deduct the amount from the customer's account balance. If the customer's balance is not sufficient, the API should return an error message.

Review books: Customers should be able to review books they have purchased. The API should allow customers to submit a rating and a review for a book.

Authentication and Authorization: The API should be secured with authentication and authorization. Customers should be able to create an account and log in using their credentials. Only authenticated customers should be able to purchase books and submit reviews.

Logging: The API should log all requests and responses to a file or database.

Project Requirements:

The API should be built using .NET Core and should follow the RESTful API design principles.

The API should use a database to store the book and customer data. You can choose any database of your choice.

The API should be unit tested and integration tested.

The code should be well-structured and modular.

The API should have proper exception handling.

The API should have proper documentation with examples of how to use the API endpoints.

Deliverables:

A GitHub repository containing the code for the API.

A README file that explains how to build and run the API.

A Postman collection that contains the API endpoints and example requests.

A document that explains the architecture of the API, the choice of database and any other design decisions.

Evaluation Criteria:

Code quality: The code should be well-structured, modular and easy to understand.

Functionality: The API should fulfill all the requirements mentioned above.

Testing: The API should be unit tested and integration tested.

Documentation: The API should have proper documentation with examples of how to use the API endpoints.

Security: The API should be secured with authentication and authorization.

Logging: The API should log all requests and responses to a file or database.
